      <p class="large-text-align-center large-10 small-12">
        We use polycarbonate that is well-known for its resilience to make the
        belt fit conveniently just by stretching both wings of the belt.
        Therefore, LumiDiet gives users great user experiences with a
        comfortable fit that is suitable for waist sizes up to 45 inches. It
        softly covers your waist and holds firmly at the same time, so you will

        LFRT(Light Fat Reduction Technology) is a newly developed technology
        that exposes our body to artificial light that has particular wavelength
        and intensity to help to reduce fat. LumiDiet has developed and applied
        LFRT to maximize the result of burning abdominal fat. This technology
        includes differentiated recipes on selection of light source, intensity,
        radiation and frequency; consequently, we optimized these parameters in
        order for us to maximize the effect of fat reduction.

        Mitochondria in cells only absorb light of specific wavelength such as
        NIR and RED to break down triglycerides into fatty acid and glycerol,
        eventually discharging them through transient pores on cell wall.
        Released components flows into lymphatic system where they are broken
        down into smaller pieces. These components then flow into circulatory
        system to be burnt for the body’s metabolism.

        According to the Arndt-Schultz Law, there is a concept called
        “therapeutic window”, which is an optimized density range for fat
        reduction. The optimal intensity formula is applied for LFRT.

        Vibration therapy offers positive results by stimulating muscles and
        metabolism and improving the flow of blood and lymph. Especially when
        appropriate amount of exercise cannot be done, vibration therapy can be
        a great substitute for spot fat/cellulite reduction as it improves the
        circulation of applied area.

        The red LED stimulates mitochondria in cells to produce energy that
        breaks down fat. The alteration of the cell chemistry triggers the
        release of an enzyme (lipase), which can break the triglyceride
        molecules down into fatty acids and glycerol molecules.

      <p class="large-text-align-center large-10 small-12">
        The small substances are discharged through the pores of the cell wall,
        then travels around the lymphatic system in the body, which are
        eventually reduced naturally or burnt through exercises. The vibration
        during or after light treatment helps our body to burn the mobilized fat
        more easily if you are not able to take the proper exercise. It also
        causes increased local circulation to targeted areas, giving the visible
        cellulite area a smoother look. The fat cells are then smaller, leaving
        you with inch loss, fat loss, and reduction of the appearance of
        cellulite!
