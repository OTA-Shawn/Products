        Light Fat Reduction Technology LFRT(Light Fat Reduction Technology) is a
        newly developed technology that exposes our body to artificial light
        that has particular wavelength and intensity to help to reduce fat.
        LumiDiet has developed and applied LFRT to maximize the result of
        burning abdominal fat. This technology includes differentiated recipes
        on selection of light source, intensity, radiation and frequency;
        consequently, we optimized these parameters in order for us to maximize
        the effect of fat reduction.

        Mitochondria in cells only absorb light of specific wavelength such as
        NIR and RED to break down triglycerides into fatty acid and glycerol,
        eventually discharging them through transient pores on cell wall.
        Released components flow into the lymphatic system where they are broken
        down into smaller pieces. These components then flow into circulatory
        system to be burnt for the body’s metabolism.

        According to the Arndt-Schultz Law, there is a concept called
        “therapeutic window”, which is an optimized density range for fat
        reduction. The optimal intensity formula is applied for LFRT.

        Vibration Therapy Vibration therapy offers positive results by
        stimulating muscles and metabolism and improving the flow of blood and
        lymph. Especially when appropriate amount of exercise cannot be done,
        vibration therapy can be a great substitute for spot fat/cellulite
        reduction as it improves the circulation of applied area.

        The small substances are discharged through the pores of the cell wall,
        then travels around the lymphatic system in the body, which are
        eventually reduced naturally or burnt through exercises. The vibration
        during or after light treatment helps our body to burn the mobilized fat
        more easily if you are not able to take the proper exercise. It also
        causes increased local circulation to targeted areas, giving the visible
        cellulite area a smoother look. The fat cells are then smaller, leaving
        you with inch loss, fat loss, and reduction of the appearance of
        cellulite!
